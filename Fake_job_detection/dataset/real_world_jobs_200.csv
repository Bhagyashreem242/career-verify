System Administrator,"The Technical Team and offering at VML London has a very strong heritage dating back to the mid-nineties when the London office was founded. Back in those days we were one of the first few purely digital marketing agencies in London; and back then things were a lot more technically driven than they often are today; as such the Technology team here continues to enjoy a strong strategic influence on the work that the agency undertakes and the clients that we engage.It just works.Technology is brilliant when you don’t have to think about it. That’s what we strive for in our solutions. Our technology team has a strong strategic influence on the work we undertake and are involved as soon as the brief lands. They stay involved throughout strategy, creative concepting and design. Acting as important enablers, we bring new and emerging technology to the table to successfully marry the requirements of our clients with the vision of our creatives.Open standards, open minds.We aim to deliver the most elegant technical solution for your budget, and maintain a technology agnostic approach to development in order to achieve that. Technology can be expensive, both in terms of hard costs and costly mistakes, so we’re as careful with your money as we are with our own.   Perhaps that’s why some of our clients have been with us for over 10 years. When faced with a new problem our first instinct is always to see if someone else has already solved it. As such, the solutions we design are built on the rich eco-system of open source software (OSS); the proven and battle-tested kind that we know will not just do the job quickly and cost-effectively, but also robustly. Where OSS isn't appropriate we always favour solutions that are built to open standards that we know will integrate well with other technologies.Strong partnerships.Our work is complemented by strong partnerships with technology vendors and suppliers.   Proven over time, our established strategic relationships with many of the leaders in software, hardware and other technology solutions help ensure we’re able to continue to offer best-in-class technical solutions for our clients.What we do:High availability and high performance website architecture &amp; developmentWeb content management solutionsCreative technology ideationContent optimisation, search and analyticsHigh volume, multi-locale email campaignsMobile optimisationLocalisation","GB, CMD, London","The role of the SAs is a vital role in the running of the platforms VML manage!

Software Engineer,,"US, CA, San Francisco","Wikispaces is looking for a software engineer to build and scale our quickly-growing education technology platform. This position is full time in our San Francisco office. We're a small team working on a big site, and we're looking for an engineer to join us. Wikispaces provides an easy-to-use wiki platform for a very large audience in education. There's lots to do: designing and building new parts of the application, working on our front-end javascript and AJAX, squeezing a few more requests/second out of our web heads, working on our replicated databases and file storage. We don't like big specifications or heavy planning processes; instead, we work on small projects, ship code frequently, and write tests. We're built on PHP, MySQL, python, javascript.

You have personally built large, interesting, or complex web applications before, and can show us what you've done. You're perfectly comfortable with relational databases like MySQL and know the ins-and-outs of writing and optimizing queries against large datasets. You can talk about a wide array of trade-offs facing web developers: use of frameworks vs. in-house code, what caching strategy to choose, how to select 3rd party libraries, what to do when table X hits 500 million rows. You're not a platform zealot, but you think Linux is a fine choice as a server OS. Above all, you love to build and ship products that real people will use every day.Why you should apply We're a small, smart, fast-moving company where you'll play a huge part in the success of our business.

Online Systems Manager (Virtual/Remote),,,"A Unique Job With a Great CompanyDo you want an exciting job you love, working with other superstars? Are you excited by making a real difference with our team? Join us as our Online Systems Manager!We’re a unique and innovative marketing technology &amp; services company… And we’re growing!Our Online Systems Manager position is a key role in our company, because you’ll be in charge of the online tools we use to service our clients, as well as promote our own services.What Do We Do?Our company has offers marketing technology and services to attorneys. We've created a proprietary combination of technology, marketing creative, and business processes that allow lawyers to plug in to our systems very quickly, and stop worrying where their next client will come from. Our customers are great people who are a pleasure to work with – and we become real partners to their business, helping them meet their goals by providing something they want and need.What Will You Do?As an Online Systems Manager, you will do two things:1) Work directly with our US-Based Client Services Managers to configure and maintain systems to deliver marketing services to our clients. Our Client Services Managers work directly with our attorney clients, and you'll support them in that effort.2) Assist with configuring marketing systems for our own marketing campaigns - the ones which bring customers to us. You'll help manage our markting automation, email campaigns, website, blog, webinars, etc.While this is not a programming job, you should be comfortable with the basic configuration of online tools. If you are comfortable deploying a Wordpress site, including adding themes and plugins, and doing basic HTML/CSS then you'll do fine. We can teach you all the other systems. If you're not completely comfortable with this level of technical configuration, then this probably isn't a fit.If you are experienced with configuring marketing automation systems (such as Infusionsoft, Office Autopilot/Ontraport, etc) then you are very qualified.Working With UsOur offices are in San Francisco, CA, but you may work remotely anywhere in the world so long as your work day overlaps with our work day (9am - 5pm Pacific) by at least two hours every work day. This is a full time position. Applicants are expected to not have any other employment, freelance or otherwise.Our Hiring ProcessOur hiring process is different. That’s because we’re serious about a long-term partnership with you, and we’re willing to put in the time up front to ensure it’s a fit for both of us. That also means you’ll need to put in extra time as well, but as a result you’ll know whether this is the place for you.Our process is designed to find superstars who want to work with other superstars. People interested in a fundamentally different organization where everyone is motivated for excellence, and everyone gets to work on things which make the most of their abilities.But, you can’t tell who’s a superstar from a resume, and it doesn’t come across in a short interview either.So our process is designed to let you get to know us, and us to get to know you, before we move on to meeting in person or via video call. We typically screen over 130 applicants before we hire someone because we’re looking for the best candidate – and one who’s also motivated to work with top-performing colleagues.As you read this process, do not get intimidated. The first steps are intended to give you a picture of who we are and what we do, so you can get a feel for what it’s like working with us. As the process goes along further, it gets more personal. If it’s a fit then rest assured you’ll have more than enough time to get all the information you need and speak personally with us to make a good decision for you.Step 1. First, you’ll fill in an application, with a little information about you. As a part of this application, you’ll be asked to answer a few questions, and also shoot us a quick video introducing yourself (60-90 seconds) so we can get a better idea of who you are. We don’t care about the quality of the video, we just want to see how you communicate since you’ll be working remotely and communication is very important for success in this role.Step 2. If your application looks like a fit, we’ll send you a series of videos about our company and its products. Watch those videos to get a sense for the problems we’re solving, and why lawyers want our solution. Then we'll ask you how your experience fits with the products you learned about in the videos.Step 3.
